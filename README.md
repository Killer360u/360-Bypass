# 360-Bypass
360 Total Security Bypass with our DLC tool 


Refud - 360 Total Security Killer Update 
1) Now killer will kill 360 completely + Inject the Virus payload in any real application so that it’s not detected + add the virus in windows startup directory so that even if user restarts his computer he will still be connected after the restart 

2) Improved injection in random software’s in pc 

3) Virus is undetected by 360 Total security 

4) IP and port will be masked now making the detection more lesser ( Analysing the payload will not help retrieve the ip and port of attacker it’s Anti Analysis  ) 

5) In case the connection breaks that’s why the virus uses another startup method knows as task scheduler that will wake up the virus from another location so connection loosing chances are zero 

6) UAC Bypass
